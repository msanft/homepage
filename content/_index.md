Hello, my name is Moritz. I currently study information security at [Ruhr-Universit√§t Bochum](https://informatik.rub.de/) and work as a security software engineer at [Edgeless Systems](https://edgeless.systems/).
I am particularly interested in trusted execution environments, confidential computing, and system security in general. I am also a big fan of [Nix](https://nixos.org/) and [Go](https://go.dev/).
