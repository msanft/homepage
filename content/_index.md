Hello, my name is Moritz. I currently pursue a master’s degree in information security at [Ruhr-Universität Bochum](https://informatik.rub.de/) and work as a security software engineer at [Edgeless Systems](https://edgeless.systems/).

I am particularly interested in confidential computing, and systems programming in general and a big fan of [Nix](https://nixos.org/) and [Go](https://go.dev/). I also engage in CTF competitions with the university’s team, [FluxFingers](https://fluxfingers.net/).
