Hello, my name is Moritz. I hold a master’s degree in CS from [Ruhr-Universität Bochum](https://informatik.rub.de/) and work as a security software engineer at [Edgeless Systems](https://edgeless.systems/).

Besides work, I spend my time on doing security research.

I engage in CTF competitions with my university’s team, [FluxFingers](https://fluxfingers.net/).
